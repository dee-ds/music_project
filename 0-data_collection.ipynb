    "### The Billboard Hot 100 Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is focused on investigating the properties of the most popular songs and possible trends occurring in the music industry. To get the proper datasets (the collection of the most popular tracks), we will scrap the [Billboard Hot 100 Ranking](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/), which evaluates the songs on the basis of their sale record (both physical and digital sales, but also radio plays and streaming; see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100) for more details). The Ranking is oriented around the United States market and can be a good predictor of the worldwide musical trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Billboard List is updated weekly and published online on Tuesdays, but the date annotated on the website is postponed to the following Saturday, when the printed version of the Billboard magazine is shipped (the charts prior to 1962 are exceptions to this rule, i.e., they are marked with Monday dates). The very first record refers to the week of [August 4, 1958](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1958-08-02/), which allows us to collect and compare the data of almost 65 years!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weekly chart combines 100 songs (with descending popularity) and contains their description (**artist** and **title**), as well as chart features, i.e., **this week position**, **last week position**, **peak position** and **the number of weeks on the Billboard List** (if the song re-enters the List, the counter is continued, not reset). We will use the available rankings to determine the songs of interest, which will be later sent for further processing."

    "Describing the scraping process concisely, its main element is the `BillboardSpider` class (a scrapy spider) defined in the <a href='music_data_scraper\\music_data_scraper\\spiders\\billboard.py'>`billboard.py`</a> file. The class allows to scrap the charts (using the `parse` method) from the Billboard website for any chosen time frame; the latter is selected using the `resp_date` and the `ending_date` parameters (as *datetimes*). The elements of the chart are collected with particular css selectors, as given in the `parse` method definition. It should be noted that we separate the 1st chart position from the remaining ones, since the website notation between them is different (the features of the first place are bolded in the table, which results in different css selectors). Each scraped record is allocated as a `BillboardItem` object with specified fields (see the <a href='music_data_scraper\\music_data_scraper\\items.py'>`items.py`</a> file for details), and then initially processed within the `BillboardItemLoader` class, as defined in the <a href='music_data_scraper\\music_data_scraper\\itemloaders.py'>`itemloaders.py`</a> file (we strip redundant escape characters, change string numerical values into integers and transform '-' (hyphen) chars into 'NaNs' - the latter corresponds to the **last week position** field, when the song entered the List for the very first time). The items are successively yielded by the method, and when the chart exhausts, a new one (for the next week) is loaded and parsed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic scraper interface can be easily built using the `'$ scrapy startproject <project_name>'` command in the terminal. To create the spider, one can navigate to the project path (`'$ cd <project_path>'`) and use the `'$ scrapy genspider <spider_name> <host_to_scrap>'` command. All the project setting are stored within the <a href='music_data_scraper\\music_data_scraper\\settings.py'>`settings.py`</a> file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Manipulating the settings, one should leave the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` parameter as default **True**, since it obeys the website provider's policy on web scraping (which should be highly respected).\n",
    "\n",
    "To initiate the scraper and save the obtained data, we have to navigate to the project catalogue and run the `'$ scrapy crawl <spider_name> -O <file_name>'` command from the terminal. In our scheme, we initiate the `billboard_spider` spider and save the results into the <a href='music_data_scraper\\billboard_data.json'>`billboard_data.json`</a> file. The charts are collected from the very first record (August 4, 1958) until the week of 27th May, 2023."

    "As we have described in the example above, in order to get the song properties, we have to find it in the Spotify database first and then query for its features. We will automate this process for the tracks stored in our Top 500 yearly rankings as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define the `spotify_audio_features` function (declared in the <a href='utils.py'>`utils.py`</a> file, where we will store all our utility functions for the Project), which uses the Spotify Web API to find the audio features and the genres of the tracks from chosen data frame (the first function argument `df`; we have to provide also the `client_id` and `client_secret` credentials for collecting the API token, which is automatically refreshed by the internal `auth_update` function if it expires).\n",
    "\n",
    "Describing the collection process shortly, in the first step we successively grab the tracks from the data frame and try to find them using the `search` API endpoint. Before each search, the labels of the artist and the song title are slightly transformed to make them more compatible with the Spotify database (e.g., we provide only the first artist if there are more creators than one, or remove the apostrophes from the song title). If the search is successful (the response contains at least one item), we compare the original track labels with the ones returned by the API to find the best match. The labels are compared using the external `labels_match` function, which examines their compatibility for chosen threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we process 50 tracks, in the next step we combine them into a batch, which is sent to the internal `save_batch` function that queries for the tracks audio features (using their Spotify IDs; we query only the matched tracks). In this step, we also access the profile of the song leading artist (the first one listed) and grab its genres. After collecting the information, the results are saved into a csv file, which is successively updated with the upcoming batches. The `spotify_audio_features` tool informs us about the current state of the data collection process and returns boolean `True` after all the tracks are processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of the procedure can be find in the <a href='spotify_API_logs\\spotify_audio_features_log.csv'>`spotify_audio_features_log.csv`</a> file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\\\n",
    "**(i)** If the original track has not been found or matched with the Spotify database, the record is saved to the final csv file with the `match=0` flag. This scenario may happen of many reasons, e.g., the song is not available in the Service, the artist nickname has changed (compared to the moment of the song release) or the Spotify labels contain diacritics (which are absent in the Billboard List), just to mention a few. As a rule of thump, the simpler the labels (single artist, simple song title with alphabetical characters only), the higher the probability of positive matching.\\\n",
    "**(ii)** If we exceed the application rate limit (which prevents the users from excessive app use), it will return the 429 response code and disallow any further requests for limited amount of time. Due to the fact that the size of our data is quite big (the Top 500 rankings with 31 423 records in total) and we call the application within very short time intervals, we have encountered one rate limit exception and had to collect the data in two separate sessions (the final file is combined using two partial ones). Notably, if we reach the app limit, the `spotify_audio_features` function will return the date and the time of next possible execution.\\\n",
    "**(iii)** In should be noted that the API can respond in other problematic ways. Spontaneously, it returns the [502 Bad Gateway Error](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/Getting-a-502-bad-gateway-when-trying-to-read-me-tracks/td-p/5315584), which can be easily handled with postponing the retry request for 5 seconds (done automatically by the function). More complex issue can occur with the `audio-features` or the `artists` endpoints, if we exceed the rate limit (we use the batched versions of the endpoints to marginalize such scenario). In this case we cannot access the value of the required delay from the response headers (see, e.g., [here](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/retry-after-header-not-accessible-in-web-app/td-p/5433144) for details; the problem is still present as of June 2023), and so the procedure (for the unprocessed tracks) has to be postponed for an unknown amount of time. Hopefully, we haven't encountered this issue with our data.\n",

    "We will conclude the data collection process with a simple bar plot visualization, showing the percentage of mismatched (or not found) tracks in each year of the Top 500 rankings. As can be seen, the most problematic records refer to the beginning years (before 1960), and the newer the tracks, the higher probability of their matching. In general, the highest mismatch ratio do not exceed the 20% threshold, with a vast majority of the results below 15%, which leaves us with at least 400 songs to operate with in each single year."
